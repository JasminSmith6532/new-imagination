   <h2>About Us</h2>
   <div class="AboutUs">
     <p>Dave and Diane moved from New Jersey to Arizona in 1977 and sometime shortly after created 'Maerz Enterprises’ and ‘Doré’ Natural Jewelry’. They focused on creating beautiful gold electroformed jewelry featuring Arizona minerals. They attended many craft and gem fairs around the state, sold to the Smithsonian Institute to supply their gift shop, and shipped mail-order all over the world.

 In the fall of 1988 they opened ‘Fantasia… The Crystal Source’ on McDowell road. After a year they moved to the store’s current location on 7th street and changed the name to ‘Fantasia… A Magical Place’. They offered a variety of crystals, metaphysical and occult goods, books, jewelry and also held many free classes each week. Amy, Dave and Diane’s daughter, spent much of her childhood at these gem fairs and worked at Fantasia for 4 years as a young adult. Dave passed away in 1997 due to complications from a heart attack. It was a difficult time for everyone. Due to stress at her hospital job, and to help her mother, Amy decided to go back to work at Fantasia in 1999.

 Diane continues to help out in the store; rolling magickal candles, making Essential Oil and Chakra kits, and helping to make many of our specialty items. Erik, Mike and Amy’s son, is now the third generation, learning to make magickal products from his mom, dad and grandmother. His newest offerings are Beeswax Reversible Candles and Essential Oil Bath Bombs.Fantasia Crystals continues to add to the shop’s inventory, to search for the lowest prices, to uphold important values, to be of service to the community, and continue to offer a wide variety of merchandise, classes, readings and more for the diverse spiritual community in the Phoenix Area. Fantasia Crystals is blessed to have such amazing family, staff and clients and plans on continuing what has been set forth by Dave and Diane in their home nearly 38 years ago. Thank you to everyone who has supported Fantasia over the years!</p>

 <div class="Philosophy">
   <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
   <p>Fantasia Crystals believes positive spirituality comes in an abundance of amazing and diverse paths, and we appreciate and support each of them. There is no better path than another, nor is there a right or a wrong one, only what may be right for for each person. Lending strength and support to them all is in everyone's best interest. We cannot allow irrational fear of what we don't understand to impede our judgment of others.Each of us are on a fantastic journey; a reflection of our heart and our will to better ourselves, our families, our communities and the world at large. The divine is in each of us -in our own unique way- when we let love and compassion drive our every word, our every deed, our every step and our every breath.Energy Workers, Healers, Metaphysicians, Spell Casters, Shamans, Wiccans, Pagans, New Agers, Heathens, Light Workers, Wizards, Earth Children, Druids, Ceremonial Magicians, Spiritual Non-Theists, Folk Practitioners and all those we missed- find joy and confidence in all that you do, without thinking less of others- We are all in this together!

   <h2>How we help</h2>
   Since our beginning over 30 years ago, Fantasia Crystals has worked hard to provide a safe place for everyone to shop and explore their spiritualities. The business and business owners have supported countless local fundraisers and charities in the form of services, physical goods, and monetary donations over the years. Many of these fundraisers involved raising awareness for social justice and human rights, protecting the earth, and bringing attention to local spiritual groups and events.  Some of the organizations we have worked with are Shoebox Ministry, Phoenix Pagan Pride Day, Natural Restorations, Phoenix Herpetological Society Sanctuary, Raven Pines Dog Rescue, Liberty Wildlife, Joy Bus Diner, Human Rights Watch, Luv of Dogs Fund, Cycling for Kids with Cancer, one·n·ten (local LGBTQ+ organization), The Amphibian Foundation, Humanistic Paganism, Valley of the Sun Pagan Projects, The Amphibian Survival Alliance, and more. We are current monthly contributors to Black Family and Child Services Inc., as well as the Human Rights Watch, because Black lives matter.  As a business we have provided support both to help stores from closing and to bolster newly established groups and organizations, helped to provide funds for hospital bills and funeral expenses for local spiritual community members, and worked hard to spread the word of inclusivity and equal rights, with an end goal of building a kinder, more compassionate world for future generations.
